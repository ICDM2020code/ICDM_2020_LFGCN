Undirected networks: Cora-ML (this Cora dataset consists of Machine Learning papers), CiteSeer and PubMed are three standard citation networks benchmark datasets used for semi-supervised learning node classification. In these citation networks, nodes represent publications, edges denote citation, the input feature matrix are bag of words and label matrix contain the class label of publication. We use the same data format as GCN, i.e., 20 labels per class in each citation network.
