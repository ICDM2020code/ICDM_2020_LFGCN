Directed networks: We evaluate our method on four directed networks - Cora, IEEE 118-bus system (IEEE bus), Texas 2000-bus system (TX bus), and South Carolina 500-bus system (SC bus). Unlike the small subset of the Cora-ML dataset (above), Cora is extracted from original dataset which contains more than 50,000 computer science research papers, where nodes represent scientific papers and directed edges between node $u$ and node v (u -> v) represent citation of paper $v$ in paper $u$. In addition to citation networks, we also test our method on power grid networks. For IEEE 118-bus system, we consider a (unweighted-directed) graph as a model for the IEEE 118-bus system where nodes represent units such as generators, loads and buses, and edges represent the transmission lines. The input features of power grid network are generator active power upper bound (PMAX) and real power demand (PD) obtained from MATPOWER case struct. For Texas 2000-bus system and South Carolina 500-bus system, we treat them as weighted directed power grid networks. In particular, we use total line charging susceptance (BR_B) as edge weight and input features are: (i) real power demand (PD); (ii) reactive power demand (QD); (iii) voltage magnitude (VM); (iv) voltage angle (VA); (v) base voltage (BASE_KV). On directed networks, we test them separately from two scenarios: (i) on Cora, the number of features are decomposed into a low dimension (130 components) based on principal component analysis (PCA), the dataset is trained with 10% label rate and evaluated in another 10% fraction whose labels are withheld; (ii) on IEEE 118-bus system, Texas 2000-bus system, and South Carolina 500-bus system, 10% label rate for training set, 20% for validation and 70% for test sets.
